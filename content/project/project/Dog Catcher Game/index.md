Designed and implemented a "pac-man" style game with the twist of dog and dog-catcher. The game made use of the SFML library in C++, with object-orientated design principles. This game won the second place prize for best software engineering project with a prize sponsored by Entelect. This project was completed with [Aaron Fainman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-fainman/).
