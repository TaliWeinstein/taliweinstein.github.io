This project explored the persuasive impact of South African COVID-19 lifestyle speeches through a proof-of-concept investigation using eNCA interviews extracted from YouTube. Using generated spectral and cepstral features from interview audio, a neural network compares their impact on persuasiveness. The cepstral feature set outperforms the spectral set, with a balanced accuracy of 86.8% and an F1 of 85.0%, indicating its higher predictive power despite challenges like overfitting and dataset size.
