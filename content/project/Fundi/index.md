This project was completed as part of my final year electrical engineering software development course and simulated the working of an agile workflow. Together with [Basheq Tarifi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basheq-tarifi/), Nathan Jones, Yasser Karem, and [Tarryn Maggs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarryn-maggs-371811182/), we produced a full-stack software application for student study group coordination. The web application was deployed with Microsoft Azure and consisted of a NodeJS, Express, and Microsoft SQL database backend, and a front-end built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Testing was done through frameworksJest for the backend and Cypress for front end-to-end testing.
