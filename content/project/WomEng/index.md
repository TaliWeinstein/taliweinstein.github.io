# Overview
This event introduced girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to the world of biomedical engineering through interactive presentations, group discussions with qualified engineers, video demonstrations, an indepth Q&A session and a hands-on microcontroller programming exercise to analyse photoplethysmography signals. The benefits of having attended this workshop included: <br/> 
1. Learning about the engineering and biomedical engineering field to assess whether
this is a viable career option <br/> 
2. Gaining resources to plan a career in biomedical engineering <br/> 
3. Interacting with biomedical engineering graduates and mentors <br/> 
4. Developing technological skills in coding, sensor interfacing and biomedical signals
through a hands-on biomedical engineering activity

# Roles and Responsibilities

Within my role as ambassador for the WomEng #1MillionGirlsinSTEM initiative, I created, planned and presented a Biomedical Unpacked Workshop. The creation of this event included:
- Designing a [proposal](uploads/WomEng/proposal.pdf) for WomEng to introduce the benefits of this novel event
- Planning a whole day workshop inclusive of presentation content, hands-on coding activity, participant handout, volenteer hand outs and volenteer training 
- Fundraising via the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand for the requisite arduino microcontrollers 
- Installing the relevent software onto rented laptops
- Producing adverts, recruiting participants and producing application content
- Screening applicants and producing indemnity forms
