# Overview
This event introduced girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to the world of biomedical engineering through interactive presentations, group discussions with qualified engineers, video demonstrations, an indepth Q&A session and a hands-on microcontroller programming exercise to analyse photoplethysmography signals. The benefits of having attended this workshop included: <br/> 
1. Learning about the engineering and biomedical engineering field to assess whether
this is a viable career option <br/> 
2. Gaining resources to plan a career in biomedical engineering <br/> 
3. Interacting with biomedical engineering graduates and mentors <br/> 
4. Developing technological skills in coding, sensor interfacing and biomedical signals
through a hands-on biomedical engineering activity'

# Roles and Responsibilities

As and ambassador on the #1MillionGirlsinSTEM initiative I created the Biomedical Unpacked Workshop. This role included:
- Designing a proposal for WomEng
- Planning a whole day workshop inclusive of presentation content, hands-on coding content, participant hand-outs, volenteer hand outs and volenteer training 
- Fundraising for the requisite arduino microcontrollers needed for the activity
- Installing the relevent software onto rented laptops
- Producing adverts, recruiting participants and producing application content
- Screening applicants and producing indemnity forms
