As part of my work with SisonkeBiotik, I led the writing of a conference paper for the [HELINA 2025: Pan African Health Informatics Association](http://easychair.org/cfp.org/cfp/HELINA2025). The paper examined key lessons learned from running workshops across different conferences, focusing on strategies for effective audience engagement and sustained community involvement. It argued that long-term impact requires workshops to go beyond one-off participation. This requires encourgaing collaborative idea formation among participants and creating spaces where these ideas can be developed and implemented. A poster based on this work was presented at the [2025 Deep Learning Indaba's poster session](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2025/posters/)
 and directly informed the design of the 2025 Data Science for Health in Africa Workshop.
