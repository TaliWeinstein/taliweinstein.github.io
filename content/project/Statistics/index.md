In this MRes course project for the Computational and Statistical Methods course, blood pressure data for a placebo and treatment group is statistically analysed via Python in a Jupyter notebook. The core focus of the project was utilising the statistical analysis to arrive at conclusions and graphically represent the data. The project is self-contained with the data included for running the notebook.
