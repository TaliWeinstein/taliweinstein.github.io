This project was completed as part of my second-year electronics course with [Alice Drozdov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-drozdov-005552180/), [Nicole Swanepoel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-swanepoel-1a9a621bb/) and [Ammaarah Akhalwaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammaarah-akhalwaya-06b118200/). The project required each member to produce a different subsystem of the steam turbine generator simulation. 
The steam turbine generator is divided into subsections namely: the power supply, exhaust gas, steam valve, turbine shaft encoder, and condenser system. My subsystem was the steam valve system which utilised a relay, SN74S08N, AND logic gate, SN74LS74A D flip-flop for the processing and switching events.
