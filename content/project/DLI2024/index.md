# Overview
This event introduced girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to the world of biomedical engineering through interactive presentations, group discussions with qualified engineers, video demonstrations, an in-depth Q&A session, and a hands-on microcontroller programming exercise to analyse photoplethysmography signals. The benefits of having attended this workshop included: <br/> 
1. Learning about the engineering and biomedical engineering field to assess whether
this is a viable career option <br/> 
2. Gaining resources to plan a career in biomedical engineering <br/> 
3. Interacting with biomedical engineering graduates and mentors <br/> 
4. Developing technological skills in coding, sensor interfacing, and biomedical signals
through a hands-on biomedical engineering activity

# Roles and Responsibilities

Within my role as ambassador for the WomEng #1MillionGirlsinSTEM initiative, I created, planned, and presented a Biomedical Unpacked Workshop. The creation of this event included:
- Designing a [proposal](proposal.pdf) for WomEng to introduce the benefits of this novel event.
- Planning a whole day workshop inclusive of [presentation content](/uploads/WomEng/slides.pdf), [hands-on coding activity](https://github.com/TaliWeinstein/biomedUnpackedWorkshop), [participant handout](/uploads/WomEng/StudentPack.pdf), [volenteer hand outs](/uploads/WomEng/VolunteerPack.pdf) and volunteer training.
- Fundraising via the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand for the requisite Arduino microcontrollers.
- Installing the relevant software onto rented laptops.
- Producing [adverts](workshopAdd.pdf), recruiting participants and producing application content.
- Screening applicants and producing indemnity forms.
