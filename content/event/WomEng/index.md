summary: An immersive workshop in 2022 which aimed to provide teenage girls with an understanding of the biomedical engineering field through hands on activities and discussion.
abstract: 'This event introduced girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to the world of biomedical engineering through interactive presentations, group discussions with qualified engineers, video demonstrations, an indepth Q&A session and a hands-on microcontroller programming exercise to analyse photoplethysmography signals. The benefits of having attended this workshop included: 

1. Learning about the engineering and biomedical engineering field to assess whether
this is a viable career option <br/> 
2. Gaining resources to plan a career in biomedical engineering <br/> 
3. Interacting with biomedical engineering graduates and mentors <br/> 
4. Developing technological skills in coding, sensor interfacing and biomedical signals
through a hands-on biomedical engineering activity'
