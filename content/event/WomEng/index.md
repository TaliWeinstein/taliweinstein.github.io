summary: An immersive workshop in 2022 which aimed to provide teenage girls with an understanding of the biomedical engineering field through hands on activities and discussion.
abstract: 'This event introduced girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to the world of biomedical engineering through interactive presentations, group discussions with qualified engineers, video demonstrations, an indepth Q&A session and a hands-on microcontroller programming exercise to analyse photoplethysmography signals. Within my role as presenter, educator, co-ordinator and facilitator -  I was responisble for ensuring that the worskhop ran smoothly while still delivering the workshop content. The workshop ran over a 4 hour period overwhich I presented to the group of 30 girls, assisted with the volenteer discussions, ran the coding solution development and provided directed assistance to the girls during the coding activity.'
