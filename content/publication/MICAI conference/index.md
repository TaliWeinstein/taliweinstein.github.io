abstract: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in healthcare, yet access to sufficient datasets, particularly in Africa, remains limited. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities surrounding medical imaging data sharing and governance in Africa. Drawing on existing research works, we explore the significance of medical imaging data, the limitations in availability, and the factors contributing to this challenge. We discuss the importance of data governance policies, the establishment of medical biobanks, and active steps towards the implementation of federated learning techniques to improve data availability and governance. Furthermore, we propose a medical imaging biobank for Africa (AfriBiobank). To enhance data interoperability, integration, and advanced analysis capabilities, we advocate for the incorporation of a semantic layer utilizing technologies such as semantic web standards and query languages, alongside medical data standards such as FHIR and DICOM, as well as adherence to linked data principles within the proposed biobank infrastructure. Furthermore, to support the storage and accessibility of data across multiple African countries, we envisage a hardware framework founded on a distributed architecture, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced cybersecurity measures, alongside the establishment of a robust data center to ensure the scalability of the biobank’s data storage capabilities. By addressing these challenges and implementing innovative solutions, Africa can unlock the full potential of scientific advancements in healthcare.
