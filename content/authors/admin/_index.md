I am a curiosity-driven biomedical and electrical engineer. I also finished my Master of Research(MRes) in Bioengineering, as the top student, at Imperial College London in the G√ºder lab. My MRes focused on extracting electrical signals from e-textiles with an initial investigation into electrochemical signal extraction.

In addition to the interdisciplinary electronic, signal processing, and electrochemical skills I acquired during my MRes degree, I have experience in developing software for solving complex problems and a working knowledge of applied machine learning.
